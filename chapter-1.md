# A Python Q&A Session

# Why do people use Python?

## Software Quality

* Designed to be readable, reusable, maintainable
* Software reuse mechanisms (OO, functional)
* Simple and readable syntax
* "Coherent": everything follows from small set of core concepts 

**Python Philosophy:**
* Explicit is better than implicit
* Simple is better than complex

## Developer Productivity

* Optimized for speed of development
  * Simple syntax
  * Dynamic typing
  * No compiling or linking
  * Built-in tools
* Python LoC 1/3-1/5 of C, C++, Java

## Program Portability

* Runs the same across major OS

## Support Libraries

* Large standard library
* Extensive third party domain

## Component Integration

* Can integrate with other technologies
  * C and C++
  * Java, .NET, COM, etc

## Enjoyment

* Subjective, but ease of use == fun

# Is Python a "Scripting Language"?

* "Object-oriented scripting language"
  * Blends procedural, functional, object-oriented paradigms

## What does "scripting language" mean? 

* Shell tools: command-line stuff, quick tools
* Control language: "glue layer" connecting other things
* Ease of use: Quickly coding tasks

Answer: Depends on who you ask, and the definition.

# What's the Downside?

## Execution Speed

* Execution is slower than compiled languages... but still pretty fast.
* Python code compiled to byte code, then interpreted.
* Byte code is platform-independent but less efficient than binary code.
* Python interpreter has bits of compiled C code.
* Speed of development gain usually offsets speed of execution loss.
  * Computers are really fast now.

## Other Stuff

* Rate of change: Lots of new stuff being added.
* Batteries included: Sometimes prebuilt stuff changes or breaks.
* Usual open-source crap: Elitism, anarchy, preferences.

# Who Uses Python Today?

* Top 5-10 most used language
* 20+ years old
* Lots of govt agencies, nonprofits, corporations

# What Can I Do with Python?

* Pretty much anything, but it's very commonly used for a few things.

## Systems Programming
